## Getting Started!


#### https://pro-gg.herokuapp.com/
 


PRO.GG focuses on allowing gamers to create profiles,browse other profiles, and meet up with people they like. 

First a user must register their account

Once registered, you automatically log in.

(But here is a shot of the log in screen)

Once logged in, a user can fully create, update, or destroy their own profile if they choose.

A unique feature of PRO.GG is that you do not need an account to browse other profiles, so feel free to look around, find people you would want to play with and then add them in game!

## Next Steps

I would like to add a search feature that will redirect the user to a new list, featuring only the designated requirements. 

I would also like to add a sort by feature on the rank section.  


## Next Project

In the next project I would like to take this concept, except utilize Riot Games Database API inorder to seed the site will all the current active users.
